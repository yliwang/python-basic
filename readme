This repository contains coding questions to grasp basic language elements of python. each question is presented along with a py file, which provides the structure of the code for the question. the name of the py file, and the function prototypes in the py file should not be modified in any circumstances. You should only add code to implement the functional specified in the question description. Of course, you can add code in the if __name__=='__main__' block to test your implementation, but this part is ignored when the py file is submitted. After the question is solved, the py file containing your implementation should be submitted, for example, if a question provides a StarTriangle.py file, the same py file with your written code should be submitted.
